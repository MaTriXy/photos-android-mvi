* Big change on how remote feed loading/refreshing works.LibrePhotos now supports incremental changes in the api.
  The old "full feed sync" process is no longer needed. Now the app should always be up to date with the server
* The media summary endpoints now also return GPS information which means that the map screen no longer
  needs to fetch ALL media item details which means that all media should be available on the map by default.
* Updating dependencies
