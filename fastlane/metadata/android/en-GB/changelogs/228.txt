* Big change on how remote feed loading/refreshing works.
  LibrePhotos now supports incremental changes in the api (https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/issues/1177).
  This allows UhuruPhotos to avoid the need for the old "full feed sync" process of making sure that all
  upstream changes are reflected in the app. Now the app should always be up to date with the server
  and there is no longer any need for the "full feed sync" process (even though it can still be accessed via settings).
* The media summary endpoints now also return GPS information which means that the map screen no longer
  needs to fetch ALL media item details which means that all media should be available on the map by default.
* Updating dependencies
