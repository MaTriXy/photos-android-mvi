* New stats page in Discover tab. For now only showing media per year, more coming soon
* Better scroll hints. Now showing month - year only and scroll hint is offset to not be under the finger
* Remembering the last heatmap viewport. Also affects the discover tab map view
* No delaying between cached media when the precaching job runs to make it faster
