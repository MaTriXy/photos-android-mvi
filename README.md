UhuruPhotos is an Android client for [LibrePhotos](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos) 
written using the latest Android technologies, like Jetpack Compose, SQLDelight, Coroutines etc 
using an MVI architecture.

It borrows a lot of ideas from Google Photos and aims to become a full featured photo album 
replacement, including features like offline support, backup and sync etc.
